                <p>  Initially we had set out this project to help bring more aware of the full menstrual cycle and highlight information regarding the different phases that is often overlooked. Learning more about one’s own body is imperative to being in tune with your own health & well-being epsecially in womens reproductive health.

As we wanted to make this more functional for college students and help to optimize their experience in the best way possible being apart of the University of Washington Seattle Campus. Although we diverted from our initial idea we still feel it is very important to provide an information hub surrounding the topic.
